# Changelog

---

## v0.11.0 — unreleased

### New features
- Added Kerberos ticket management (`--kerberos`) for Linux and macOS — Px
  acquires and renews Kerberos tickets automatically using `kinit` with the
  configured `--username` and password from `PX_PASSWORD` or keyring. No keytab
  file is created. Addresses #252 and #258.

### Bug fixes
- Fixed auth failure recovery when a Kerberos ticket becomes available after Px
  startup — clearing `MCURL.failed` allows previously-blocked proxies to be
  retried (#258).

### Docker
- Consolidated `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile-mini` into a single multi-stage
  `Dockerfile` with a `mini` build target.
- Added `BUILDER` build arg to support both CI (pre-built wheel) and local
  (source tree) builds.
- The full Docker image now requires `--cap-add IPC_LOCK` — gnome-keyring 48+
  (Alpine 3.23+) links libcap-ng which aborts without the `IPC_LOCK` capability.
- Gracefully handle keyring failures in `get_password()` so Px logs the error
  and falls back instead of crashing.

### Improvements
- Reduced per-request overhead in `reload_proxy()` with double-checked locking
  to avoid acquiring the state lock when a reload is not needed.
- Cached `get_curl_features()` result at startup since libcurl features never
  change at runtime, avoiding repeated FFI calls on every proxied request.
- Cached the `noproxy_hosts` joined string on the `Wproxy` object so it is
  only recomputed when proxy information is reloaded, not on every request.
- Replaced `copy.deepcopy()` with shallow copy for the immutable proxy server
  list returned by `find_proxy_for_url()`.
- Used tuples instead of lists for membership checks in the request hot path.

## v0.10.3 — 2026-03-11

### Bug fixes
- Fixed #248 — check install cmd if modified.
- Fixed #255 — handle Python v3.13 runtime context on startup.
- Fixed `set_client_auth()` mutating the global `AUTH_SUPPORTED` list when
  called with `ANY` or `ANYSAFE` — now copies the list.
- Fixed `cfg_int_init()`/`cfg_float_init()` passing invalid string values to
  callbacks when config values fail to parse — now falls back to default.
- Fixed `send_html()` in handler inserting a tuple instead of a string into
  the error page `explain` field.
- Fixed `file_url_to_local_path()` returning `None` for non-Windows file URLs.
- Fixed `--hostonly` and `--quit` failing in emulated/virtualized environments
  (QEMU, Docker on ARM) by adding a fallback when `psutil.net_if_stats()` is
  unavailable ([psutil#2693](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/2693)).

### Improvements
- Replaced `quickjs` dependency with `quickjs-ng`.
- Dropped Python 3.8 and 3.9 support; minimum is now Python 3.10.
- Added Python 3.14 classifier.
- Restructured `README.md` with basic install/config/usage info and full
  `github.com` links (for PyPI/Docker Hub display).
- Made `docs/configuration.md` a complete user-facing reference with all CLI
  flags, environment variables, INI keys, defaults, and auth types.
- Split detailed documentation into user-facing (`docs/installation.md`,
  `docs/usage.md`, `docs/configuration.md`) and developer (`docs/architecture.md`,
  `docs/build.md`, `docs/testing.md`) sections.

### Internal
- Modernised project tooling: ruff, mypy, pre-commit, Makefile, `docs/` folder.
- CI workflow (`ci.yml`) now triggers on `devel` push and PRs only (not
  `master`). Test matrix expanded to 9 jobs: Ubuntu on Python 3.10–3.14, macOS
  on 3.10 and 3.14, Windows on 3.10 and 3.14.
- Build workflow (`build.yml`) now triggers on `master` push and
  `workflow_dispatch` only. Docker build and push steps merged into the
  `release` job (separate `docker` job removed).
- Added Dependabot configuration for monthly pip and GitHub Actions updates.
- `tools.py`: all `sys.exit()` calls changed to `sys.exit(1)` for proper error
  propagation. Docker function updated to accept `--push` flag and
  `--wheels-dir` option for CI usage.
- `build.sh`: added `build_local` function for end-to-end local build and test
  using Docker containers (musl or glibc). Added `auditwheel` to pip install in
  `build_binary` for both musl and glibc. Added error checking (`|| return 1`)
  to `build_local` steps.
- Added `test-musl` and `test-glibc` Makefile targets for local container
  testing.
- Updated GitHub Actions to Node 24: `actions/setup-python` v6,
  `astral-sh/setup-uv` v7, Docker actions v4.
- Fixed build workflow: Linux musl Nuitka builds now use Alpine containers
  (both x86_64 and aarch64) since musllinux containers lack Python dev headers
  needed by Nuitka. Linux glibc builds use Python 3.13 from the manylinux
  container (`/opt/python/cp313-cp313/`). All Linux container builds install
  `uv` via curl consistently.
- Fixed test-binary workflow: release archives from the binary job are now
  extracted before testing. The `PXBIN` environment variable is now properly
  exported to tox so the `binary` tox environment actually tests the compiled
  Nuitka/embedded binary.
- Resolved ruff violations in `px/` package — reduced suppressed rules to
  minimal intentional set.
- Ported `HISTORY.txt` to `docs/changelog.md` and removed the original file.
- Expanded `docs/architecture.md` with State singleton, request handling, spnego
  monkey-patching, PAC evaluation, proxy reload, and error handling details.
- Expanded pytest suite: added `test_debug.py`, `test_wproxy.py`, `test_pac.py`,
  `test_network.py`; expanded `test_config.py` with unit tests for utility
  functions and defaults. Deleted legacy `test.py`.
- Updated tox configuration to run all test files.
- Added `./mcurllib` as local wheel index to Makefile install for testing with
  unreleased mcurl versions.
- Cleaned up `tools.py`: removed obsolete functions (`get_curl`, `pyinstaller`,
  `scoop`, and all GitHub API release management). Remaining targets are
  `--wheel`, `--nuitka`, `--embed`, `--deps`, `--depspkg`, and `--docker`.
- Removed old `build.sh` and `build.ps1` monolithic build scripts — replaced
  by GitHub Actions workflows and the new `build.sh` function library.
- Added GitHub Actions CI workflow (`ci.yml`) with quality checks and test
  matrix across Python 3.10–3.14 on ubuntu, macos, and windows.
- Added GitHub Actions build workflow (`build.yml`) for wheels, Nuitka/embedded
  binaries, multi-distro testing, GitHub release posting, and PyPI publishing.
  Platform matrix covers all targets where both `pymcurl` and `quickjs-ng`
  provide wheels.
- Added shared `.github/actions/setup-python-env` composite action.
- Added `build.sh` as a shell function library sourced by `build.yml`. It
  consolidates repeated CI scaffolding (uv installation, Python discovery,
  wheel building, binary building, archive extraction, test execution) into
  reusable functions, keeping `build.yml` concise.
- Refactored `tools.py`: made `pymcurl` import lazy so the script can run
  without it installed (guards in `curl()` and `nuitka()`). Added
  `make_archive_with_hash()` helper to deduplicate archive+hash blocks.
  Added `--history` flag to print the latest changelog section (used by the
  release job). Made version import resilient with a `pyproject.toml`
  fallback when `px-proxy` is not installed as a package.

## v0.10.2 — 2025-04-07

### Bug fixes
- Fixed #246 — resolved crash caused by PAC hostname resolution.

### New features
- Added gui script `pxw.exe` to run Px in the background on Windows, addressing
  #203, #213 and #235 by providing correct path for `px.ini` and logs.
- Enhanced `px --install` to write `--config=path` into the registry to support
  non-standard locations for `px.ini`.

  Px in the background on Windows startup.
- Added support to read and write `px.ini` from the user config directory.
- Fixed #218 — improved config load order to cwd, user config or script path
  if file already exists. If `--save`, the file should be writable, otherwise use
  the user config directory.

### Breaking changes
- Replaced ctypes-based libcurl backend with `pymcurl` which uses cffi and includes
